# Feijoa UI

A barebones UI component recipe-kit! Like shadcn/ui++!

## Usage:

TODO!

## Local Development:

### Getting Started:

```sh
bun install
```

```sh
bun dev
```

## Inspiration / Dependencies:

This project wouldn't be possible without the following:

- [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/)
  - This project is itself a thin wrapper around shadcn/ui - with a few more
    components added in
  - We'll try to remain as up to date as possible with the work being done
    within shadcn/ui, but if we're missing anything that exists there feel free
    to open an issue or a PR to address!
